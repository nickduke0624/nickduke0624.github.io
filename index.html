        <h2>My Site!</h2>
     <p>This is my first attempt at creating a programming website using HTML coding! I am a senior at URI and am very excited about continuing to learn
         intracacies of programming. I have already been able to learn a lot in just a few days and anticipate what knowledge
         is next to come. I do not know exactly what to write for this paragraph portion per site, but will fill it in as I am explained the
        structure of these sites.</p>
